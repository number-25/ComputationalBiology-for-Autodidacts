    "# Chapter 3 - Julia's support for scaling projects \n",
    "\"In this chapter, you will learn elements of the Julia language that are important when creating larger projects. We start with exploring Julia’s type system. Understanding how type hierarchy works is essential to learning how to define multiple methods for a single function, a topic we started discussing in section 2.4. Similarly, when you use an existing function, you must know how to find out which types of arguments it accepts. Getting an exception because you tried to pass an argument of incorrect type when calling a function is one of the most common errors when working in Julia. To avoid such problems, you must have a good understanding of how Julia’s type system is designed.\" "

    "An important aspect of using the @benchmark macro is that we use `$x` instead of just x. This is needed to get a correct assessment of execution time of the expressions we check. As a rule, remember to prefix with `$` all global variables you use in the expressions you want to benchmark (this applies only to benchmarking and is not a general rule when using macros). For details about this requirement, refer to the documentation of the BenchmarkTools.jl package (https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl). The short explanation is as follows. Recall that since x is a global variable, code using it is not type stable. When the @benchmark macro sees the `$x`, it is instructed to turn the x variable into one that is local (and thus type stable) before running the benchmarks."

# Some parameters in the population genetics of mutations
Taken from ["The population genetics of mutations: good, bad and indifferent"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2871823/) 

This is also a good exercise in MathJax formatting within markdown! 

| Notation                           | Definition                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $U$                                | mutation rate per generation per genome; check context for effects of mutations                                                                      |
| $G_e , G$                          | effective haploid genome size (all functional base pairs), total haploid genome size (with neutral sites)                                     |
| $\mu , \mu_{10} , \mu_{01}$        | mutation rate per locus or per site per generation, away from the preferred base, and back                                                           |
| $\kappa , \mathbf{boldface}{tn/tv} | mutational bias: $\mu_{10}/\mu_{01}$, transition/transversion ratio                                                                                  |
| $r_e , r_{co} , r_{gc}$            | effective recombination rate, cross over rate, gene conversion rate                                                                                  |
| $s$                                | selection coefficient; measures changes in fitness; check context for exact definitions (homozygous or heterozygous; positive or negative) |
| $h$                                | dominance coefficient so that *sh* is the effect of heterozygous mutations                                                                           |
| **DME (or DFE)**                   | distribution of mutational effects on fitness                                                                                                        |
| ${W_A}$                              | Wrightian fitness of a genotype A (one of the many ways fitness can be defined)                                                                      |
| $\varepsilon$                      | epistasis: interactions of mutational effects. If fitness is multiplicative, $\varepsilon = W_{AB} - W_AW_B$                                   |

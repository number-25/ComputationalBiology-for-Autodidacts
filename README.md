# Computational Biology for Autodidacts
A collection of resources that I have used (and hereby endorse) for those looking to teach themselves Computational Biology, as well as the branching disciplines which greatly influence comp. bio., such as Probability, Information Theory, Mathematics and so on. 

I will also include a separate list of resources that I have come across and been recommended, but have not used - as such, these will not be my endorsements, but simply references for you to explore further if you wish.


The main home of this webpage is over at my website ["Kobe and Pascal"](https://kobeandpascal.com/computational-biology-for-autodidacts/)

## Books and eBooks

### Unix-Linux
#### Unix Workbench
The fundamental starting point in computational biology is the terminal window. It may terrify you at first, but please persist, and move forward with excitement as you begin traversing your system in a completely new way. Believe me, right now things may seem so rosy and magical as you whiz around in your general user interface (GUI), coddled by the ease of point and click, but with enough time, you will begin dreading the clunkiness of some GUI programs. The majority of tools in computational biology are built around a unix/linux system, and as such these are generally the very basic requirements. Embarking on a journey of learning unix based systems, in my opinion, comes with committing to a philosophy of open software and freedom of access to information. This is fundamentally about love. Love of education, love of knowledge, love of others, and a love of those that come after us. It is not surprising that almost every resource I have come across has offered a free version alongside paid options. 

You will begin seeing how fundamental and necessesary these programs are for the proper functioning of modern day Scientific research. Hopefully you will appreciate how beautifully efficient they are, and the elegance of simple bash programs who aim to do one thing right.

You likely want to begin here, and take yourself so far, probably stopping right before you reach the vim vs. emacs wars. After youâ€™re proficient in simple processes, then you can spend your precious time pondering whether org-mode is worth trying.

* Sean also kindly provides a Coursera unit which follows the structure of the book - highly recommended.

#### Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous
This is a companion resource to Unix Workbench, it begins at the same skill level (beginner), and like Unix Workbench, works through the essentials, with a focus on pragmatism. Having a go at the exercises is worth while, and creating a personal cheat sheet of sorts is also not a bad idea. Straight forward, stimulating and very helpful for the beginner.

### Specific Computational Biology Texts
#### Biostars Handbook

One of the most empowering developments to come out of bioinformatics/computational biology education is [Biostars](https://www.biostars.org/). I would put my money on it that the word "Biostars" is familiar to every single student in this field. The legendary forum for finding answers to what seems to be, every practical question you could think of. [Istvan Albert](https://github.com/ialbert) and his colleagues have gone ahead and condensed their understanding into the Biostar Handbook, which, at a very reasonable price (especially when it comes to textbooks) brings you up to speed, and in my opinion, gets you very close to being competent and independent. What I love most about this book is its brutal honesty, its transparency and its emphasis of diligence and patience. They have slowly started breaking the book up into more specific and parcelized mini-books that focus on a particular topic. Another big benefit of this is that Istvan generously provides full access to his University lectures, which are also terrific.

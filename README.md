# Computational Biology for Autodidacts
A collection of resources that I have used (and hereby endorse) for those looking to teach themselves Computational Biology, as well as the branching disciplines which greatly influence comp. bio., such as Probability, Information Theory, Mathematics and so on. 

I will also include a separate list of resources that I have come across and been recommended, but have not used - as such, these will not be my endorsements, but simply references for you to explore further if you wish.

### Biostars Handbook

One of the most empowering developments to come out of bioinformatics/computational biology education is [Biostars](https://www.biostars.org/). I would put my money on it that the word "Biostars" is familiar to every single student in this field. The legendary forum for finding answers to what seems to be, every practical question you could think of. [Istvan Albert](https://github.com/ialbert) and his colleagues have gone ahead and condensed their understanding into the Biostar Handbook, which, at a very reasonable price (especially when it comes to textbooks) brings you up to speed, and in my opinion, gets you very close to being competent and independent. What I love most about this book is its brutal honesty, its transparency and its emphasis of diligence and patience. They have slowly started breaking the book up into more specific and parcelized mini-books that focus on a particular topic. Another big benefit of this is that Istvan generously provides full access to his University lectures, which are also terrific.

# Computational Biology for Autodidacts
A collection of resources that I have used (and hereby endorse) for those looking to teach themselves Computational Biology, as well as the branching disciplines which greatly influence comp. bio., such as Probability, Information Theory, Mathematics and so on. 

I will also include a separate list of resources that I have come across and been recommended, but have not used - as such, these will not be my endorsements, but simply references for you to explore further if you wish.


The main home of this webpage is over at my website ["Kobe and Pascal"](https://kobeandpascal.com/computational-biology-for-autodidacts/)

## The Command Line 

### Unix-Linux
#### Unix Workbench
The fundamental starting point in computational biology is the terminal window. It may terrify you at first, but please persist, and move forward with excitement as you begin traversing your system in a completely new way. Believe me, right now things may seem so rosy and magical as you whiz around in your general user interface (GUI), coddled by the ease of point and click, but with enough time, you will begin dreading the clunkiness of some GUI programs. The majority of tools in computational biology are built around a unix/linux system, and as such these are generally the very basic requirements. Embarking on a journey of learning unix based systems, in my opinion, comes with committing to a philosophy of open software and freedom of access to information. This is fundamentally about love. Love of education, love of knowledge, love of others, and a love of those that come after us. It is not surprising that almost every resource I have come across has offered a free version alongside paid options. 

You will begin seeing how fundamental and necessesary these programs are for the proper functioning of modern day Scientific research. Hopefully you will appreciate how beautifully efficient they are, and the elegance of simple bash programs who aim to do one thing right.

You likely want to begin here, and take yourself so far, probably stopping right before you reach the vim vs. emacs wars. After youâ€™re proficient in simple processes, then you can spend your precious time pondering whether org-mode is worth trying.

* https://github.com/seankross/the-unix-workbench 
* Sean also kindly provides a Coursera unit which follows the structure of the book - highly recommended.

#### Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous
This is a companion resource to Unix Workbench, it begins at the same skill level (beginner), and like Unix Workbench, works through the essentials, with a focus on pragmatism. Having a go at the exercises is worth while, and creating a personal cheat sheet of sorts is also not a bad idea. Straight forward, stimulating and very helpful for the beginner.

## Specific Computational Biology Texts
#### Biostars Handbook

One of the most empowering developments to come out of bioinformatics/computational biology education is [Biostars](https://www.biostars.org/). I would put my money on it that the word "Biostars" is familiar to every single student in this field. The legendary forum for finding answers to what seems to be, every practical question you could think of. [Istvan Albert](https://github.com/ialbert) and his colleagues have gone ahead and condensed their understanding into the Biostar Handbook, which, at a very reasonable price (especially when it comes to textbooks) brings you up to speed, and in my opinion, gets you very close to being competent and independent. What I love most about this book is its brutal honesty, its transparency and its emphasis of diligence and patience. They have slowly started breaking the book up into more specific and parcelized mini-books that focus on a particular topic. Another big benefit of this is that Istvan generously provides full access to his University lectures, which are also terrific.

#### Computational Biology: A HyperTextbook

In searching for a beginner level computational biology text that was up to date with more recent developments in the field, I found it surprisingly difficult to track anything down that was released less than 5 years ago. Either the text's were focused on a specific section of comp. bio., such as sequence matching algorithms, or they were highly recommended relics released at the advent of high throughput sequencing - classics indeed, but insufficient for a wholesome entry into the current field. Scrolling through twitter I saw a recommendation for Scott Kelly's and Denis Didulo's "Computational Biology: A Hypertextbook" - it seemed to tick all the boxes. Despite the lack of reviews and anecdotes, I took the chance and purchased the e-book. Given it's main selling point is that it is a Hypertext-book, I figured using the print form would be too clunky. So far I am very happy with the purchase - it is generalised enough for a beginner, yet still specific in ways that Biostars isn't. For example it has chapters on essentials such as how exactly the Smith-Waterman algorithm functions and so on. An excellent reference text which deserves more attention! My biggest hunch here is not with the textbook exactly, but rather with the ebook medium which it uses - a service called VitalSource, a underpowered platform which allows you to purchase books on how to use linux, only to then realise that their standalone offline apps do not come with Linux compatibility!! How you would open the book on Linux if you lacked internet connection is a mystery to me. Either way - the book is great.

## Courses 

#### Foundations of Computational and Systems Biology 
I can't be the only one who's jaw hits the floor when they see how rich MIT Open Course Ware has become, and how far back their content reaches in time. There are perhaps no better examples of the spirit of education than this initiative. Free lectures by some of the worlds top thinkers? You've gotta be kidding me. MIT Open Courserware was made for auto-didacts, there is little more you could ask for when seeking to educate yourself. Detailed course structures and trajectories, additional recommended readings, good quality videos, and no pay walls - yes!  

This course is run by a couple of great educators (Christopher Burge, David Gifford &amp; Ernest Fraenkel), who are also highly capable Scientists in their own right. For one, Chris Burge is one of the pioneers of *ab initio* gene prediction, a highly successful paradigm which allowed us to understand and annotate much of the early high throughput sequencing data. He is also centrally involved in the popular "Mixture of Isoforms" [(MISO)](https://sci-hub.st/10.1038/nmeth.1528) package. I recommend watching each lecture closely and definitely reading the accompanying writings. This is quite the intensive program if you decide to apply yourself, and it covers a sufficiently broad sweep of the field to give you the confidence to move forwards.

#### Applied Computational Genomics at the University of Utah (2020/2021)
If you've had to do play around with .bam and .bed files than you've very likely come in contact with the excellent program called [Bedtools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). Almost every time I need to use this program I discover something new about it, it just keeps on giving. The brain behind the Bedtools is [Aaron Quinlan](http://quinlanlab.org), a leading Computational Biologist out of the University of Utah . He offers a Semester long, **completely free** course which lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/quinlan-lab/applied-computational-genomics). Do you notice the trend here? World class thinkers who are willing to spread their knowledge, help others, and move Science forward, all without paywalls. Pay it forward if you ever get the chance! This is a great, in depth course which has many practical tutorials embedded within it. The homework is challenging and fulfilling - I have learned a lot here. Did I mention that Aaron is a terrific, down to earth teacher?

## Mathematics, Probability, and Statistics
Coming from Biology, a field closely wedded to the qualitative aspects of Scientific inference, where our formal training for the most part omits many of the approaches utilised by the 'harder sciences', the transition to the quantitative world has perhaps been the most challenging part of this. In some respects, you must undergo a great change in how you approach problems, how you approach data and measures, and your relationship to truth and validity. Much of this can be uncomfortable, as you must confront the fragility of your prior approaches to questions. Personally, this is an ongoing project which demands a lot of effort and grit. I have immensely appreciated this change in my thought processes, and am very grateful that it has taken place. The world is a bigger place now than it ever was. A world where precision, consistency, and repetition are emphasised. You will likely develop an obsession with priors, and with starting assumptions. Sometimes before we can even approach a problem, we must sketch out some vague axioms we believe to be important. Unfortunately, these topics are taught in notoriously bland ways across campuses alike - they are premature, are forced, and very often, the student barely has any confidence in their own logic and reasoning. Such courses may at times skip over the very basic reason for using tools such as probability theory in the first place; to make *better* decisions in the presence of uncertainty.

### Statistics
#### Intuitive Biostatistics: A Nonmathematical Guide to Statistical Thinking
I believe this is the most comfortable introduction to conceptualising problems, and answers, in a more quantitative manner. As the title outlines, this book is almost purely built on intuitive explanations of key, widely used procedures in statistics. It explains what x is, when you would do x, why you would do it, why you wouldn't, and more appropriately, the assumptions and biases associated with x. If you're afraid of equations (overcome this fear as soon as possible, there is nothing to fear), you'll be given that first bit of confidence that should then give you the enthusiasm and energy to continue developing. The language here is very clear, very direct, very concise and to the point. The text is very honest, and works hard to provide bountiful examples of both good and bad uses of statistics in the literature. You will enjoy working through it, trust! The author Harvey Motulsky is the founder of [GraphPad](https://www.graphpad.com/company/) Statistical Analysis software, so you may have already come across his creations without knowing! There is also a smaller streamlined text from Harvey called "Essential Biostatistics", which is also worth reading if you just need a straight forward and reduced explanation. One last note, this book leans heavily towards biomedical research, and so most of the examples pull directly from this field. Strongly recommended. 

* PERFECT for absolute beginners. Great reference to have on hand for those more familiar. 
* I must admit, the book is not [cheap](https://www.bookdepository.com/Intuitive-Biostatistics-Harvey-Motulsky/9780190643560?ref=grid-view&amp;qid=1612414949560&amp;sr=1-1), and the smaller "Essential" book is just not worth buying - it is an anorexic ~150 pages of widely spaced formatting. I used library copies for both until I had enough savings to purchase the larger of the two books. If you prefer eBooks than I'd go looking.
